# Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL

Institution: HKBK College of Engineering, Bangalore | Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka

• Visualised the working environment of Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge aka “Bascule Bridge” using OpenGL. 
• It works with counterweights that balances the span and upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. 
• Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. 
• Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. 
• All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user. 
• An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. 
• We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. 
• The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, and physics.
